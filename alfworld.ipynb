    "The `client.chat.completions.create` function can accept several key parameters when making a request:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **model**: Specifies which OpenAI model to use, like `\"gpt-4\"`.\n",
    "2. **messages**: A list of messages that form the conversation history. Each message is an object with a `\"role\"` (e.g., `\"user\"`, `\"assistant\"`, `\"system\"`) and `\"content\"` which contains the text.\n",
    "3. **temperature**: Controls the randomness of the model's output. A lower value makes the output more deterministic, while a higher value increases diversity.\n",
    "4. **max_tokens**: Limits the number of tokens in the generated response.\n",
    "5. **top_p**: Implements nucleus sampling; it considers only the tokens that make up the top `p` probability mass.\n",
    "6. **n**: Specifies how many completion choices to generate.\n",
    "7. **stream**: If set to `true`, it streams back partial progress as the output is generated.\n",
    "8. **stop**: Specifies a stopping sequence, where the model stops generating further tokens.\n",
    "9. **presence_penalty** and **frequency_penalty**: These parameters penalize new versus repeated tokens respectively to control the diversity and repetitiveness of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters offer flexibility in shaping the responses generated by the model, allowing you to fine-tune the output to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information, you can refer to the official [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/chat/completions/create)【6†source】【7†source】【8†source】."
